Self-taught amateur coder, interested in Front-End Dev and Business Intelligence. I would like someday to be able to create apps for businesses to satisfy various querks in the way their employees get the job done. 
If you have any projects or would like someone to bounce-off some ideas, or even want to collaborate on stuff, hit me up.
